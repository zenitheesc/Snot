# Snot
 Zenith Aerospace despair tracker, made with satelite remains and a dream, named after the comercial tracker Spot.

It is based on the Caurin board, a London board, and a unnamed battery board, all from old satelite projects. An u-blox MAX-M8Q GPS module was added and Snot was born.

It uses a low consumption power profile, which enables it to run for days (it dangled in a tree in Brasilia for three days and it worked until the time we rescued it, good enough for me).
